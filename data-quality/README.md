# Sample data quality definitions for use in Cloud Pak for Data 4.8.2

The .zip file contains 190 prebuilt data quality definitions that you can import to a project in Cloud Pak for Data 4.8.2, and use for creating data quality rules.

For easier evaluation of which definitions you actually want to make available to other users, create a separate project.

To add the data quality definitions, follow these instructions:

1. Download the `SampleDataQualityDefinitions_CPD.zip` file.
1. In Cloud Pak for Data, go to **Projects > All projects** and click **New Project**.
1. Select **Create a project from a file**.
1. Upload the `SampleDataQualityDefinitions_CPD.zip` file.

The new project contains all prebuilt data quality definitions. For more information, see the product documentation:
